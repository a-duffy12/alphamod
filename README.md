# alphamod
Minecraft mod designed to improve vanilla experience with better mid-late game balancing, while still keeping the vanilla feel

Alphamod is the working name of this Minecraft mod. At the time of inception, Minecraft lacked balance among its in-game item tiers, among
other areas. The goal of this mod is to improve the mid-late game experience for survival Minecraft while still retaining the "feel" of
vanilla Minecraft. 

This mod adds two new tool classes (Amber and Obsidian). At the time of release, Diamond is the superior tool in all stat categories 
except for Enchantability and Mining Speed, both of which Gold is faster in. However, Gold has non-existent Durability and Damage, and as
such Gold tools are only a novelty, and Diamond is functionly superior to all other tiers by a significant margin. The addition of Amber
alters this, as Amber is a high-end resource. Amber tools deal more Damage than Diamond ones, and have durability slightly lower than Iron.
Obsidian is the other tier, which can mine the same blocks as Diamond, and has massive amounts of Durability, but has the poor Damage,
Speed, and Enchantability of Stone. It essentially acts as a replacement for the "worker Stone picks/axes/shovels", as Obsidian versions
have the same performance, but enough Durability to equate to rougly 62 of their Stone counterparts. Overall this balances the tool tiers 
so that Diamond has the most overall value, but for niche scenarios a different tool type is more useful. Diamond has the 2nd highest stat
in each category, but Amber has the best Damage, Gold the best Speed and Enchantability, Obsidian the highest Durability, with Iron being
the most easily obtainable and only renewable resource among the higher tiers. Amber itself is found as an ore in the Overworld, with a
higher spawn rate in Jungle biomes.

Another major addition is the tool class of Knives. Knives come in all the same tiers as the other tools, including Amber and Obsidian. 
Knives are very useful at destroying vegetation (like a machete). The main draw of Knives is to be a counterpart to Axes for combat. Many
Minecraft players dislike the cooldown between attacks added in 1.9, so Knives are meant to mitigate that. Knives can attack at a rate 8x
that of Swords, however they deal significantly less damage. The end result is a higher DPS than both Swords and Axes, but Knife durability
depletes more rapidly than the other combat tools, so they are a high-risk, high-reward tool. 

The final additions include Bone Armor to give bone more uses, and make a mid-tier armor more useful. In most playthroughs, Iron armor is
obtained very early on, and players stick with this until late game when they upgrade to full Diamong. This is due to the rarity of gold
relative to its strength, and the time it takes to collect Leather, which is inferior to the easier to find Iron. Chainmail armor is not
obtainable in survival so it is also irrelevant. Bone armor is therefore an easy to obtain armor type, that requires no mining. To make
up for its ease of attaining, it is less effective than Iron. However, it looks really cool!

Last but not least is Black Sand, Black Sandstone, and all the blocks that derive from them. These are based off of volcanic sands, and can
be found in the new Volcano and Volcanic Beach biomes, along with the ore Basalt, which drops an Obsidian Shard upong mining. These
Obsidian Shards can be crafted in groups of 9 to get Obsidian, or used to make Obsidian tools.
